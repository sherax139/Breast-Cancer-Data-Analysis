Analysis and Visualization of METABRIC Breast Cancer Dataset


Introduction
Most of us know that someone who struggled with breast cancer, or at least heard about the struggles that patient facing patients who are fighting against breast cancer disease. Breast Cancer is one of the most commonly and frequently occurring type of cancer among women effecting about 2 millions of women in a single year and it is estimated that near about 626,000 women died from breast cancer alone in 2018.

Diseases like cancer are interconnected with the genetic malfunctioning also called as gene mutation. mainly happens when some of the cells present in women breast start to grow and divide abnormally than that of healthy cells.

About the Dataset
The Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) database is a Canadian Project which contains targeted sequencing data of 1,900+ primary breast cancer samples.The dataset contains both the clinical and genomic data that was downloaded from kaggle.com.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghadalharbi/breast-cancer-gene-expression-profiles-metabric/download?datasetVersionNumber=1

The dataset is divided into two parts But for this research we will only use the Clinical Dataset:

Clinical attributes
The clinical data includes the clinical treatment, cancer and patient details.

Genomic attributes
The genetics part of the dataset contains m-RNA levels z-score(The number of standard deviations away from the mean of expression in the reference population) for 331 genes, and mutation for 175 genes.

Formula for calculating z-score :

z = (expression in tumor sample - mean expression in reference sample) / standard deviation of expression in reference sample
